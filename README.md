# MIMIC-III Mortality Prediction

This project is focused on predicting patient mortality using the MIMIC-III dataset. We use both structured and unstructured data to train a fusion model to predict mortality.

# Dataset

The MIMIC-III dataset consists of deidentified health-related data from patients who were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. We use the dataset to extract structured data such as patient demographics, vital signs, and lab test results, as well as unstructured data such as clinical notes.

# Installation

To run this project, you will need to have access to the MIMIC-III dataset. You can request access to the dataset by following the instructions on the MIMIC-III website.

Once you have access to the dataset, you can follow these steps to install the necessary dependencies and run the project:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter notebook mortality_prediction.ipynb to train the model and make predictions.
Usage
To use this project, you will need to have the MIMIC-III dataset and access to a Jupyter notebook environment. Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can open the Jupyter notebook mimiciii_mortality_prediction.ipynb and follow the instructions to train the model and make predictions.
